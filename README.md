The code in this repository serves as supplementary resource code for the article titled "Low-burden and precursor-free cell-cell communication in mammalian cells enabled by de novo design of super-sensitive intercellular signals" (Sun et al.), published in Cell Systems.
This repository contains a code script for analyzing the transcriptomic profile analysis of the chassis cell burden effect of Cinn-based mammalian cell intercellular communication modules.
The raw RNA-Seq transcriptome data is not included in this repository. Please contact the corresponding author of the article if needed.
Further information and requests should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the corresponding author of the article.
